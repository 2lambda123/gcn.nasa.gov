## What are GCN Circulars?

GCN Circulars are rapid astronomical bulletins submitted by and distributed to community members worldwide. There are an average of about 6 GCN Circulars per day.

- Circulars are **brief**, **citeable**, and **human-readable**.
- Circulars can announce **observations**, **quantitative near-term predictions**, **requests for follow-up observations**, or **future observing plans**.

Circulars allow the GRB community to submit messages to a central queue where they are automatically vetted and distributed (via email) to the entire GRB community. Circulars are prose-style messages from follow-up observers reporting on their results, or for coordinating with others.

# Deployment

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you encounter issues during the deployment process, follow these troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify that the correct AWS credentials are configured.
2. Check that the environment variables are correctly set.
3. Ensure that the correct AWS region is specified.

This web site is deployed **in the cloud** on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) in order resist outages due to local network conditions or distasters.

Site assets are replicated and cached through a global **[content delivery network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)** ([AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)) to provide the fastest experience possible to scientists everywhere regardless of their country and location.

The site's architecture within AWS is entirely **[serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)**: we run on fully managed AWS computing, storage, and database services so that resource usage and cost adjust dynamically with user demand and so that we do not have to patch or maintain the operating systems on our own machine instances.

We provision all AWS resources using **[infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)** so that the configuration of cloud services is automated and under version control. We use the [Architect](https://arc.codes/) serverless framework to model, generate, and orchestrate the AWS resources.

We perform code and infrastructure changes automatically using **[continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)** on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (see our [deployment workflow](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

## Common Deployment Errors and Resolutions

Here are some common deployment errors and their resolutions:
1. **Error**: AWS credentials not found.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure that the AWS credentials are correctly configured in the GitHub repository secrets.

2. **Error**: Invalid AWS region specified.
   - **Resolution**: Verify that the correct AWS region is specified in the deployment configuration.

3. **Error**: Environment variables not set.
   - **Resolution**: Confirm that all required environment variables are correctly set in the deployment workflow.

## Stages

There are three full deployments of GCN. Each **deployment stage** is in a separate AWS account and on a separate subdomain:
